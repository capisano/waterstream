This works for a batch of videos if the watermark is in the same place consistently across them:

Load one video into Avidemux (https://www.fosshub.com/Avidemux.html). 
If you are on linux you might be able to get it through your package manager.

We aren't actually going to do the editing in this application. But it has a feature that we can use to 
allow us to script something up.

In Avidemux under Video Output on the left-hand side, select a codec, and then click on the filters button.

The filter we are looking for is MPlayer DeLogo. It might be under Sharpness. Once you open it you'll have
a new window with the first frame of your video and an adjustable box. Use this window to find the right X,Y,Width,Height
settings are for the watermark you are trying to remove.

If there are multiple watermarks you will have to do this once for each one, taking note of the watermarks coordinates.

Now that we have those coordinates the rest is actually very simple. You will need ffmpeg installed.


Below is a sample bash script:

#!/bin/bash
# Replace the delogo values for what you found in avidemuxs
# For multiple watermarks you will have to run ffmpeg once for each one,
# saving and then working off of temp files in the process until you've applied all filters
# Pretty trivial to script but just ask someone if you get stuck
mkdir -p ~/delogo
for video in $(ls *.mp4); do
	ffmpeg -i $video -filter:v "delogo=x=90:y=120:w=389:h=97" ~/delogo/$video
done
